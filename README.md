moodle-course-format_page
=========================

A deeply enhanced flexipage format for high level course content editing.

Version notes
=============

New Moodle 2 version of flexipage from MoodleRooms fixes most of the misses of the Moodle 1.9 version this review enhances.
 There is actually no plan to migrate this review to Moodle 2, unless we suspect that essential features not handled by
MoodleRooms version were absolutely necessary for some of our projects.

Use essentially the MOODLE_19_STABLE branch to get the 1.9 version or refer to MoodleRooms distribution for
Moodle 2.x version.
